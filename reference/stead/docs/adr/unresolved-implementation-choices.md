# Unresolved implementation choices requiring ADRs

**Status:** Active candidate queue; nine candidates are resolved, and the remaining entries are deferred to their named decision point<br>
**Rule:** An ADR may select among conforming options; it may not silently change a locked decision.

## Admission test

A choice belongs here only when it is unresolved by the directive and has durable effects on a public/cross-module contract, security boundary, source of truth, operational topology, compatibility, portability, or difficult-to-reverse data representation. Library versions, local refactors, test-tool selection, and other reversible implementation details remain ordinary issues subject to license review.

Each accepted ADR must state requirement IDs, options including status quo, decision drivers, security/classification and privacy effects, affected contracts/owners, standards mapping, data migration/backward compatibility, upgrade/rollback/recovery, test and observability changes, dependency/license evidence, and a supersession plan. Locked-decision changes additionally require explicit project-owner approval.

Phase 0 fixed each candidate's non-negotiable boundary without selecting its physical implementation. None is a conflict introduced by the v0.2 reconciliation. A proposed record remains blocking until every required approval is recorded against an immutable revision; each candidate in the deferred tables remains `DEFERRED` until a decision record is admitted and accepted.

## Resolved candidates

| Candidate | Disposition | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `ADR-CAND-001` Canonical URI and compatibility profile | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-08-29 | [ADR-0001](./0001-canonical-uri-and-compatibility-profile.md) selects registered provider/host-independent `urn:uuid` identity with globally unique UUIDv7, mandatory separate tenancy/kind fields, a server-derived trusted-origin browser URL, version coexistence, redirects, migration, rollback, non-disclosure, and conformance tests. |
| `ADR-CAND-002` PostgreSQL module isolation and cross-module reads | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-08-30 at `cc3dba0ccd740d18d138be52648fd4dba2008af5` | [ADR-0007](./0007-postgresql-module-isolation-and-transaction-coordination.md) selects one Stead database with exact module schemas/roles, registry-bound routines and safe read views, typed owner transaction participants, WS-02-only outbox access, owner-scoped migrations, and versioned read contracts/projections. |
| `ADR-CAND-003` Authorization and policy-decision topology | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-08-30 at `24c74d52ef0a78840ab147da48c3d66589e49e3e` | [ADR-0005](./0005-authorization-and-policy-decision-topology.md) selects the native in-process Go evaluator, one fail-closed coordinator, zero decision caching, a signed deployment-selected normal `request_boundary` path with one logical composed-read authorization/audit operation, typed strict `commit_boundary` seams, durable effect permits where disclosure/effects outlive ordinary finite reads, revision fencing, and short-lived provider credentials. |
| `ADR-CAND-004` Security-label algebra and profile identifiers | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-08-30 at `24c74d52ef0a78840ab147da48c3d66589e49e3e` | [ADR-0002](./0002-security-label-algebra-and-profile-identifiers.md) selects a profile-generic partial order, conservative joins, closed monotone semantic tables, stable identifier semantics without privileged profile IDs, distinct label/profile/bundle revisions, profile-ID-keyed ceilings, digest-bound external-mapping evidence, and v0.1 denial of all cross-profile composition/non-empty bridge sets. |
| `ADR-CAND-005` Trusted principal and runtime-attribute normalization | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-08-30 at `24c74d52ef0a78840ab147da48c3d66589e49e3e` | [ADR-0003](./0003-trusted-principal-and-runtime-attributes.md) selects typed authority-bound assertions, deterministic precedence/conflict/freshness rules, immutable OIDC/SCIM correlation, revision fencing, and task/runtime-bound Agent evidence. |
| `ADR-CAND-006` Event tenant/domain partition and replay contract | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-09-03 at `87bd96041234415847d8a4f96ac7c13f3923fe6c` | [ADR-0008](./0008-nats-stream-subject-retention-replay-ordering-and-dlq.md) selects one internal Stead application account and two fixed streams per deployment security domain, locked event subjects, service-role credentials, no Organization-time broker provisioning, WS-02-owned provider-neutral canonical outbox recovery data and fenced publication generation, WS-07-owned registry semantics and NATS publish/read-back handling, consumer-owned completion state, and WS-12-owned rendering/recovery operations. A duplicate acknowledgement requires exact leader-served read-back; a missing copy advances generation and republishes unchanged canonical bytes. |
| `ADR-CAND-007` Policy-bundle distribution and trust roots | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-08-30 at `24c74d52ef0a78840ab147da48c3d66589e49e3e` | [ADR-0006](./0006-signed-policy-bundle-distribution-and-activation.md) selects the Stead Policy Activation Set v1, reproducible unsigned content, DSSE/P-256 signing, deployment-policy-driven thresholds/custody/cryptographic assurance, offline trust rotation, and atomic OpenFGA/policy activation; TUF is considered but is not the v1 activation authority. |
| `ADR-CAND-021` Initial Team relation model | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-08-30 at `24c74d52ef0a78840ab147da48c3d66589e49e3e` | [ADR-0004](./0004-initial-team-role-and-authorization-semantics.md) selects fixed explicit `lead`, `member`, and `contributor` relations while preserving zero hierarchy/accountability inheritance. |

## Accepted provider reconciliation decision

| Candidate | Disposition | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `ADR-CAND-008` Provider reconciliation conflict semantics | `ACCEPTED` on 2026-09-05 at `b64384249a82f6f744ec07a002f70de6e24e15e6` | [ADR-0009](./0009-gitea-provider-reconciliation-precedence-and-conflict-handling.md) selects closed precedence, one fresh authorization for a bounded internal read plan, durable one-use permits for excluded effects, effective-principal canonical acceptance fencing, and projection-backed ordinary reads. Required reviews and explicit project-owner approval are recorded in [the approval record](../governance/adr-0009-approval-record.md). |

## Proposed decisions awaiting approval

None.

## Deferred choices required before dependent implementation

| Candidate | Decision genuinely left open | Non-negotiable constraints | Owner / reviewers | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|

If an approved Phase 0 contract resolves one of these choices directly and records the complete rationale/effects, the architecture owner may convert the candidate into that contract's decision record rather than duplicate it. The decision must still be immutable, reviewable, and linked from this queue.

## Deferred ADRs with explicit decision points

These decisions are real but do not authorize Phase 0 to design feature depth prematurely.

| Candidate | Decide no later than | Decision and trigger | Locked constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADR-CAND-009` Document collaboration persistence | Before Phase 2 collaboration implementation | Yjs update/snapshot persistence, compaction, branch/PR interaction, reconnect/conflict recovery, and deterministic Markdown projection | TipTap Markdown editor; Yjs before 1.0; Git/Markdown/OKF system of record; no edit loss; repository security boundary |
| `ADR-CAND-010` Commonplace fallback | Beta integration checkpoint only if upstream/headless path cannot meet unified UX | Continue removable patch queue or activate native docs UI fallback, with objective compatibility evidence | Upstream-first Gitea/auth/headless/token hooks; no iframe primary UX; no permanent fork or divergent data model; project-owner-approved ADR required for fallback |
| `ADR-CAND-011` Search domain isolation and semantic profile | Before Phase 2 scale or high-assurance search | PostgreSQL index partitioning, optional vector model/data flow, OpenSearch logical/physical separation, rebuild/cutover and leakage-resistant aggregation | Search is projection; SearchProvider; authoritative OpenFGA and policy-decision filtering; no leaked totals/facets/snippets/suggestions; no required external service |
| `ADR-CAND-012` Blob delivery and partition topology | Before first non-filesystem BlobStore implementation | Gateway-streamed versus scoped short-lived URLs, provider partition keys/buckets/accounts, malware-scan quarantine, encryption metadata, and locator migration | Provider-independent model; platform authorization/policy-controlled URL; organization/domain/classification partitioning; no locator exposed; portable manifests |
| `ADR-CAND-013` Runner isolation and trust tiers | Before Phase 2 runner pools | Supported isolation engine(s), ephemeral cleanup proof, cache/network boundaries, privileged exception mechanism, workload credentials, and classification-pool admission | Gitea Actions; ephemeral by default; deployment security-domain policy controls egress; separate pools; no lower-to-higher access; approved pinned actions |
| `ADR-CAND-014` Audit tamper-evidence scheme | Before Phase 3 tamper-evident audit implementation | Partition/hash-chain structure, checkpoint signer/trust rotation, external anchoring options, retention and verification/export format | Append-only required fields; no unnecessary content/secrets; offline/air-gap and SIEM/object/syslog exports; no required cloud |
| `ADR-CAND-015` Deployment cryptographic-assurance boundary | Before any production deployment policy requires a validated cryptographic boundary | Exact validated modules/providers, TLS/key/storage integration boundaries, approved-mode detection, evidence, fail/rollback behavior | The active deployment policy determines required assurance; support FIPS 140-3-validated modules/algorithms where applicable without claiming validation for an unvalidated build; no label-profile ID changes crypto behavior; no mandatory cloud; offline capable |
| `ADR-CAND-016` Migration identity/collision and redirect model | Before Phase 2 importer writes canonical data | Principal correlation, duplicate/collision rules, preserved authorship, immutable source keys, canonical redirect precedence, delta/cutover conflict policy | Resumable/idempotent staged subsystem; preserve listed history/provenance; unsupported constructs explicit; canonical ontology unchanged |
| `ADR-CAND-017` Agent interoperability profile | Before implementing the first executable agent integration | MCP tool/resource surface and versioning, external-runtime registration, A2A/Agent Card profile, delegation handoff, credential lifetime, cancellation/revocation, and compatibility lifecycle | Platform APIs and platform-wide MCP for canonical business access; scoped direct Git only; no provider-specific business API; no required model, SDK, runtime, orchestrator, or provider; Phase 0 preserves seams but implements none of this execution surface |
| `ADR-CAND-018` Controlled typed properties | Before any Phase 2 local-field implementation | Whether to permit the bounded text/number/date/fixed-select/User/Agent/Team/resource-reference property set, its storage/index/export representation, limits, and compatibility | No scripts, custom validation/workflow, authorization/classification use, mandatory-field fragmentation, primary navigation, or new ontology; Phase 1 has no user-defined fields |
| `ADR-CAND-019` Recurring work and automation | Before any scheduler or event-rule implementation | Schedule/rule identity, idempotency, authority, execution limits, failure/retry, audit, and migration model | Rules act only through Platform APIs/events on canonical resources; no arbitrary workflow scripting engine; security/classification and initiating/acting principal context remain mandatory |
| `ADR-CAND-020` External guest principals | Before any external/guest collaboration | Principal representation, invitation/federation, visible marking, scope, independent revocation, lifecycle, audit, export and deployment-domain defaults | No implicit organization membership or human-role inheritance; disabled by default whenever the active deployment security-domain policy requires it unless explicitly approved; no provider-specific guest identity leaks into canonical contracts |

## Choices that do not currently require an ADR

- Naming the repository/project **Stead** and using the locked `stead-web`, `stead-api`, `stead-worker`, and `steadctl` deployable component names.
- Choosing a formatter, linter, test runner, or patch version that stays inside approved contracts and license policy.
- Adding a test fixture, diagnostic message, or internal refactor that changes no contract, policy result, data representation, or boundary.
- Organization display labels, branding, tags, notification settings, and approved provider configuration already permitted by PRIN-003 and UX-005.
- Selecting between directive-permitted deployment adapters for a particular installation; changing required supported profiles or making one cloud mandatory would require an ADR and project-owner approval.
- Reconciling the v0.2 open-work requirements with the previously approved agent-ready requirements as recorded in `PHASE0_RECONCILIATION_REPORT.md`; no locked decisions conflict.
- Using the stable discriminator `service_account` for the canonical Service Principal entity while documenting `service_principal` as the v0.2 source term; this is a compatibility-preserving name mapping, not a second entity.

## Explicitly not reopened

No candidate in this list invites reconsideration of stock Gitea, the Devlane primary frontend, Commonplace non-forking, language choices, PostgreSQL, NATS, transactional outbox, OpenFGA, the mandatory deterministic policy-decision boundary and semantics, Git/Markdown/OKF, fixed ontology/workflow, tracker repositories, container-level classification, required standards, deployment portability, cross-domain prohibition, open-source essential security, Apache-2.0 default, or the prohibited dependency classes. `ADR-CAND-003` may select a conforming evaluator; it may not remove or weaken that boundary.
