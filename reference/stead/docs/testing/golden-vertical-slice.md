# Golden vertical-slice scenarios and executable test plan

Status: **Approved Phase 0 test contract; Phase 1 implementation is dependency-ordered**
Primary requirements: `TEST-009`, `TEST-010`, `TEST-002`–`TEST-008`, `AUTH-006`, `CLS-003`, `CLS-006`–`CLS-008`, `EVT-001`–`EVT-004`, `AGENT-001`–`AGENT-007`, `PERF-001`–`PERF-006`

Phase 1 must prove two paths in one product and canonical model. The general-work path is independently useful and never creates a code repository. The software path is an additive capability extension. A pass requires all positive and negative assertions before and after restore and supported upgrade; retries preserve the first failure and cannot convert it to pass.

## Shared fixture and environment

- `ORG-ALPHA`; parent `TEAM-OPERATIONS`; child `TEAM-PEOPLE`; contributing `TEAM-LEGAL`.
- `ID-AUTHOR`, `ID-REVIEWER`, `ID-LOW`, `ID-NO-NTK`, and `ID-SECURITY-OFFICER` with synthetic trusted attributes.
- `AGENT-BACKEND` and contract-only `AGENT-RUN-SHAPE`; no runtime or execution endpoint.
- one starter/reference profile label below that profile's deployment-domain ceiling; the signed standard deployment selects `request_boundary`; a synthetic third-profile fixture proves profile-ID neutrality; a synthetic high-assurance non-government deployment selects `commit_boundary`; and negative missing/unknown/profile-derived-mode, compartment, wrong-profile, every v0.1 cross-profile operation/non-empty bridge set, and ceiling fixtures.
- clean local install with pinned Gitea, PostgreSQL, NATS, OpenFGA, the policy-decision layer, filesystem BlobStore, and PostgreSQL SearchProvider.

The harness records source revision; component/image/provider/schema/model/policy/profile/deployment-policy versions and digests; signed disclosure mode; fixture versions; benchmark device/network/topology/corpus/load/warmth labels; OpenTelemetry correlation; safe state hashes; p50/p95/p99 latency; database query count/time and write count; OpenFGA and provider call count/time; response and eager-JavaScript sizes; Core Web Vitals; projection lag; test results; retries; baseline comparison; and reviewer identities.

## TEST-009 — General-work scenario

| ID | Action | Required assertions |
|---|---|---|
| `GWS-001-INSTALL` | Install the supported local profile. | NATS exists from start; no unapproved outbound call; health/config/install audit; no agent runtime. |
| `GWS-002-IDENTITY` | Authenticate `ID-AUTHOR`. | Trusted attributes include authority/version/review-or-expiry; short session; audit; no browser service credential. |
| `GWS-003-TEAMS` | Create Organization `ORG-ALPHA`, then parent/child Teams and explicit memberships. | Organization has a stable canonical ID; Team IDs are stable; same Organization; no cycle; depth ≤12; reparent audited; parent membership/view does not grant child view and inverse does not grant parent view. |
| `GWS-004-PROJECT` | Create `general` Project `ONB`, owned by People and contributed to by Legal. | Capabilities exactly Work+Docs; Project lifecycle `active`; ownership/contribution grants no access; Overview/Work/Docs only; no Code/Delivery/provider vocabulary; useful primary route content within 500 ms and normally one composed BFF request after shell load. |
| `GWS-005-PROVISION` | Observe provisioning. | One hidden Gitea tracker repo/board and one docs repo; **no code repository**; provider APIs only; effective container policy reconciled; local rebuildable provider projection; ordinary screen reads make zero synchronous Gitea calls. |
| `GWS-006-WORK` | Create `ONB-1` deliverable, update status, assign User then Agent. | Canonical type/status/priority/key; Gitea-backed content; agent assignment accepted canonically but grants neither view nor execution; ETag conflict; outbox/audit atomic. |
| `GWS-007-KNOWLEDGE` | Create an Organization policy, Team procedure, and Project specification. | Exactly one correct container each; stable ID/path independence; deterministic safe Markdown/OKF; separate Git container where policy differs. |
| `GWS-008-CONNECT` | Embed a live Work view, convert document text to Work, link Work and specification. | Live query is authorized at render; typed links/deep links/context strip; no copied stale task table; current context preserved in peek. |
| `GWS-009-EVENTS` | Process create/update/webhook events; force duplicate, restart, out-of-order, DLQ, replay. | Authoritative transaction returns before outbox publication; NATS is never awaited; one durable effect; per-resource order only; controlled replay; projections rebuild; actor/requester/correlation/causation preserved; event-to-visible projection target p95 ≤1 s and ceiling ≤5 s. |
| `GWS-010-ATTENTION` | Inspect Home, Inbox, Team/Project rollups, Activity, notifications, and search. | Useful authorized results across Team/Project/Work/Document/Person/Agent; counts/facets/suggestions/relationships filtered before response with set-oriented SQL/OpenFGA/policy and invariant query/provider/auth-call counts; remote first useful search results p95 ≤300 ms. |
| `GWS-011-NONDISCLOSURE` | Probe as low, no-need-to-know, security-officer, and parent-only principals via UI/API/search/graph/inbox/export/errors/raw Gitea/Git; race label raise and revoke around disclosure. | No title, ID, existence, count, snippet, suggestion, notification, relationship, timing/error distinction, or direct-path access. Security officer can manage policy metadata without content read. In standard `request_boundary`, mutation-first suppresses; request-boundary-first may finish only that finite response; every later operation denies; one composed read creates at most one safe aggregate audit operation. Commit-mode selection is contract-tested but full transport proof is later-phase evidence. |
| `GWS-012-AGENT-SEAM` | Validate Agent, AgentRun, assignment, OpenFGA/policy-decision, audit/event, MCP/A2A schemas. | `requested_by=user:alice` and `actor=agent:backend-agent`; task/delegation/runtime/classification inputs; explicit independent revocation; no broad inheritance, runtime endpoint, dispatch, model/prompt/memory, or tool catalog. |
| `GWS-013-RECOVERY` | Backup; destroy only disposable deployment; restore cleanly. | All authoritative state/config/policy/audit/Git/blob data restored; IDs, hashes, labels, access, links stable; projections rebuild without NATS as sole source. |
| `GWS-014-UPGRADE` | Upgrade within supported matrix with injected failure. | Preflight, backup, expand/contract order, smoke, report, audit, and documented rollback or forward recovery; no acknowledged-write loss. |

TEST-009 fails if a code repository exists, Code/Delivery UI or software terminology appears, Team hierarchy causes access, or any denied metadata is observable.

## TEST-010 — Software-capability extension

Begin from the same shell/model and create a `software` Project `STEAD`, owned by an Engineering Team. Do not alter global navigation, canonical Work/Document values, object surfaces, or authorization flow.

| ID | Action | Required assertions |
|---|---|---|
| `SWS-001-CAPABILITIES` | Create software preset and inspect navigation. | Work+Docs+SCM+review+CI+packages+releases active; Code and Delivery visible only when authorized; Pull Requests under Code and build/package/release/artifact under Delivery. |
| `SWS-002-WORK-DOC` | Create `deliverable` and `problem`, specification and decision. | UI may display Feature/Bug and Architecture Decision; API/events/exports retain universal values. |
| `SWS-003-CODE` | Create code repo, branch, commit, and Pull Request linked to Work/Doc. | Project ≠ repository; tracker hidden; supported Gitea APIs/Git only; central permission reconciliation; canonical links. |
| `SWS-004-REVIEW-EVENT` | Request review and merge. | Authorized grouped Inbox/Activity; idempotent webhook; Work/Doc/PR graph; correlation/causation and audit complete. |
| `SWS-005-DELIVERY` | Run pinned approved action; create Build, SBOM, Artifact, Package, Release. | Isolated permitted runner, short credential, no secret leakage, OCI/SPDX/provenance/digest links, authorized download. |
| `SWS-006-SEARCH` | Query connected Project as allowed and denied principals. | Authorized Work/Docs/Code/Delivery results and graph only; no disabled/denied capabilities or aggregates. |
| `SWS-007-PROVIDER` | Run current, prior two minor, and next-candidate Gitea suites as applicable. | No database/internal API; compatibility/preflight evidence; raw provider remains restricted escape route. |
| `SWS-008-RECOVERY` | Repeat restore and supported upgrade smoke. | Canonical IDs/links/provenance remain; no permission/label weakening; provider rollback/forward recovery documented. |
| `SWS-009-CAPABILITY-CHANGE` | Restrict, deactivate, then re-enable an optional software capability. | Existing provider data and canonical links are preserved; hidden capability routes, navigation, counts, suggestions, events, and notifications do not leak; authorization is rechecked; re-enable restores the surface without identity or provenance changes. |

## Cross-cutting suites

| Layer | Required coverage |
|---|---|
| Schema/API/event | OWGP examples; OpenAPI/RFC 9457; AsyncAPI/CloudEvents; principal/container/capability/lifecycle; compatible evolution. |
| OpenFGA/policy-decision | Every relation/decision row; hierarchy non-inheritance; assignment non-grant; trusted expiry; agent intersection/revocation; 100% decision-row and ≥90% critical mutation coverage. |
| Unit/property/fuzz | fixed enums/cardinality, UUIDv7, hierarchy cycles/depth, capability dependencies, label join/no-lowering, Markdown/frontmatter, webhooks/importers. |
| Integration/replay | transaction+outbox, provider reconciliation, duplicate/out-of-order/restart/DLQ, authorized projection rebuild, audit completeness. |
| Browser/accessibility | both paths, six persona journeys, keyboard/screen reader parity, WCAG 2.2 AA, deep links/context preservation, immediate acknowledgement, preserved list/filter/scroll/selection, cached Peek, safe prefetch/optimism and invalidation, no Devlane route/ontology dependency, and profile-driven authoritative text/markings/banners/badges with color supplemental and no profile-ID branch. |
| Security/classification | lower sensitivity, missing compartment/need-to-know, admin/security officer, expired data, downgrade, every bypass, export/backup/log/runner/cross-domain denial. |
| Operations | fresh install, doctor, no-network high-assurance air gap when applicable, consistent backup/restore, supported upgrade, injected rollback/forward recovery. |
| Supply chain/performance | dependency/license/SBOM/signature/provenance gates; `T-PERF-001`–`006`; one composed-request, zero ordinary-provider-call and zero NATS-wait assertions; query/OpenFGA/provider/write-count N+1 tests; Go microbenchmarks; standard end-to-end/browser targets; ≤250 KiB gzip eager shell with lazy capability chunks; projection lag; reproducible SLO/load/chaos fixtures; and independently justified failure for >10% critical golden-path regression. |

## Evidence and release rule

The signed evidence manifest maps every assertion to requirements, source revision, artifacts, safe hashes, versions, exact disclosure mode, benchmark labels and measurements, duration, first failure, and independent reviewers. An unauthorized disclosure, acknowledged-write loss, label weakening, missing audit, non-restorable backup, secret leakage, prohibited dependency, unavailable or materially regressed general path, unexplained critical-metric regression over ten percent, absolute performance-ceiling failure, or accidental agent execution surface is release-blocking and has no ordinary waiver.
