# Stead epic and issue hierarchy

Status: Phase 0 baselined; Phase 1 foundation active<br>
Normative source: `docs/architecture/MASTER_BUILD_DIRECTIVE.md`

This hierarchy decomposes the directive without changing its locked architecture or fixed ontology. The exhaustive requirement-to-issue mapping is in [the traceability register](../../specs/traceability/requirements.yaml). The complete machine-readable issue contracts are in [the implementation issue catalog](implementation-issue-catalog.yaml).

Deferred implementation choices are enforced by the [ADR candidate implementation-gate index](../governance/adr-candidate-index.md). Passing `GATE-P0-APPROVED` does not waive a candidate's issue-specific decision deadline.

## Controlling rule

Phase 0 contract, architecture, planning, threat-model, test-design, and governance work is baselined at tag `phase0`. ADR-0002 through ADR-0006 are accepted at immutable decision revision `24c74d52ef0a78840ab147da48c3d66589e49e3e`; ADR-0007 is accepted at immutable decision revision `cc3dba0ccd740d18d138be52648fd4dba2008af5`. Decision acceptance does not supply implementation evidence. `STEAD-P1-001` is `COMPLETED_PHASE_1`; later Phase 1 issues remain `DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED` until their exact remaining dependencies and ADR gates pass, and every Phase 2–3 issue is `PHASE_GATED`.

`GATE-P0-APPROVED` is `APPROVED` against tag `phase0`, immutable commit `e24a4d9d05ad6df19c5bcaa9c385ee74fd5d8c31`, with the five dispositions recorded in the closeout packet. The gate opens dependency-ready work only. Any proposed change to a locked decision still requires its own ADR and project-owner approval.

## Phase 1 executable vertical slice

`STEAD-P1-001` is complete. All later Phase 1 issues remain dependency/ADR-gated; the ordering deliberately establishes central authorization before any provider-backed protected workflow.

The Phase 1 records preserve the approved principal, assignment, authorization, audit/event, API/MCP, scoped-Git, and classification seams. They implement the standard `request_boundary` vertical path, reserve typed `commit_boundary` seams, and establish performance instrumentation before feature expansion. They do not implicitly authorize agent orchestration, prompting, model hosting, agent memory, AgentRun execution, or A2A dispatch.

No Phase 2 issue opens merely because its implementation dependency is merged. The Phase 1 candidate must pass STEAD-P1-012 and receive its recorded release decision.

## Phase 2 Pilot/Beta

These issues are `PHASE_GATED` and depend on successful Phase 1 independent validation and its recorded release decision.

## Phase 3 Production 1.0

These issues are `PHASE_GATED` and depend on the successful Pilot/Beta gate.

| Order | Issue | Owner | Direct predecessors | Deliverable |

| 2 | STEAD-P3-008 | WS-13 | P3-001…007 | Independent Production 1.0 security and release decision |

## Mandatory issue contract

Every issue in the machine-readable catalog explicitly states:

- requirement IDs and one accountable owner;
- dependencies, module, and owned directories;
- prohibited boundaries;
- measurable acceptance criteria and named automated tests;
- expected request count, SQL behavior, provider calls, authorization strategy, synchronous writes, frontend bundle impact, and benchmark or concrete not-sensitive reason;
- authorization and classification behavior;
- observability and audit requirements;
- migration and backward-compatibility implications;
- upgrade and rollback behavior;
- documentation obligations.

Any future child implementation issue must restate these fields with a narrower scope. It may not rely on a parent link as a substitute. An implementation issue remains incomplete until its tests, documentation, observability, migration, authorization, classification, audit, upgrade, rollback, and independent review obligations are satisfied.

## Agent-ready compatibility boundary

Phase 0 models identity as a principal union containing at least `user`, `agent`, and `service_account`; permits an agent principal in canonical work-item assignment; reserves agent relationships and future delegation/task/runtime inputs in OpenFGA and the policy-decision layer; and lets CloudEvents and audit records distinguish an acting principal from the initiating/requesting principal.

Future agent business access is through canonical Platform APIs and the platform-wide MCP boundary. Scoped direct Git credentials are the only permitted direct provider path. Phase 0 delivers only the canonical Agent/AgentRun schemas and MCP/A2A compatibility contracts; MCP tools, A2A dispatch, Agent Registry behavior, and agent execution remain out of scope.

The future authorization result must be capable of intersecting delegator authority, agent-specific authority, task scope, runtime security domain, session/environment constraints, and resource classification/handling rules. The compatibility schema grants no authority by itself.

Phase 0 explicitly excludes implementation of agent orchestration, prompting, model hosting, memory, AgentRun execution, A2A dispatch, and a full MCP tool catalog. Introducing any of them requires a separately approved post-Phase-0 issue and any applicable ADR; it cannot be smuggled into a schema or integration task.

## Gate semantics

- Phase 0 review can reject, amend, or approve a contract. Amendments that alter a locked decision require an ADR and project-owner approval.
- WS-13 is independent of the implementation owner and may not approve its own implementation.
- A missing test, release artifact, required audit event, backup/restore result, install/upgrade result, clean license decision, or unresolved unauthorized-disclosure path fails the applicable candidate.
- A waiver for a critical/high vulnerability must be documented, authorized, and time bounded. There is no waiver for a known unauthorized disclosure path.
- Passing one phase does not waive unmet requirements assigned to a later release; the traceability register remains authoritative for release targeting.
