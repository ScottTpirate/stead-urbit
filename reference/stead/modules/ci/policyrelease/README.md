# Stead policy activation release builder v1

This package implements the WS-09 construction side of ADR-0006. It creates
deterministic unsigned activation content, external DSSE signing requests,
strict ustar archives for exact returned activation envelopes, post-signing
release-attestation requests, and an immutable archive-plus-attestation handoff.

It deliberately does not contain a signing function, private-key input, trust
store, OpenFGA or policy evaluator, database port, activation pointer, or
runtime authorization decision. WS-06 independently verifies cryptography,
trust, compatibility, conformance, and activation prerequisites before these
bytes can gain authority.

## Construction order

The sole public lifecycle boundary is an `ObservedWorkflow`; its methods make
the non-circular order explicit while the deterministic builders remain
unexported:

1. `ObservedWorkflow.PrepareUnsigned(BuildInput)` validates bounded inputs, creates
   `evidence/pre-signing-evidence-manifest.json`, emits canonical manifest bytes,
   computes the policy/evidence/activation identities, and emits an activation
   `SigningRequestV1`.
2. A signing service or offline ceremony operating under separately owned
   custody signs the exact request payload. It returns exact DSSE envelope
   bytes and digest-bound, caller-presented receipts canonicalized with
   `NewPresentedSigningResult`; the builder never receives a key. These
   receipts remain `unverified_presented_material` and do not establish signer
   identity, custody, trust, threshold satisfaction, or authority.
3. `ObservedWorkflow.FinalizeActivationArchive` checks only bounded DSSE syntax, exact payload,
   canonical DER/low-S shape, exact signature-byte receipt binding, and that
   enough distinct key-ID/custodian claims were presented for the deployment
   policy's requested counts. It does not verify ECDSA or trust. It writes and
   re-inspects one deterministic ustar archive for those exact envelope bytes.
4. A network-disabled workflow may present a digest-addressed check receipt for
   that exact archive. Its claimed outcome is labeled unverified and is not
   activation authority.
5. `ObservedWorkflow.PrepareReleaseAttestation` binds the final activation-set, envelope,
   archive, embedded evidence, policy/model/trust/deployment-policy, exact
   disclosure mode, presented assurance, signature/custodian claims, source,
   digest-addressed review and waiver receipts, builder/workflow, and offline
   check identities. Every caller assertion remains explicitly presented and
   unverified. Its payload contains neither its own ID nor its future envelope
   digest and declares `authority: none`.
6. The separate release ceremony signs that exact attestation request.
   `ObservedWorkflow.FinalizeReleaseHandoff` repeats the syntax, binding, and presented-count
   checks and returns exact archive and attestation-envelope bytes plus every
   immutable identity needed by WS-06. The handoff declares `authority: none`
   and a typed `required_not_performed_by_ws09` WS-06 verification checklist.

ECDSA ceremonies are not assumed deterministic. Unsigned bytes are
reproducible; an archive is reproducible once one exact returned activation
envelope is fixed; every new signing ceremony gets new envelope/archive and
attestation identities.

## Deterministic content and embedded evidence

Typed structs and Go `encoding/json` emit UTF-8 JSON in fixed field order with
no insignificant whitespace. Arrays without semantic order are sorted. Times
must be second-precision UTC RFC 3339. JSON member admission is exact-case:
case-folded aliases, including an exact member plus an alias, reject. Unknown
v1 versions, media types, deployment modes, malformed/duplicate-key JSON,
floating-point numbers in signed payloads, unbound payload files, and digest
mismatches fail closed. Package-produced failures expose only a stable code;
their compatibility `Field` and `Err` members remain empty, so
attacker-controlled member/path/parser text is neither rendered nor retained.

The four v1 contract roles are closed and mandatory: `decision_table`,
`input_schema`, `output_schema`, and `registries`. The canonical v1
policy-content index has its fixed media type and contains one sorted
role/path/media-type/SHA-256 entry for every semantic `payload/` file other
than itself. That includes contract files, every profile and authoritative
snapshot, the OpenFGA source, deployment policy, presented assurance result,
trust set, and trust-set envelope. Missing, extra, stale, reordered, duplicate,
or noncanonical index material rejects. Because `policy_bundle_id` hashes these
exact index bytes, any semantic payload update creates a new bundle identity
and invalidates review/provenance subjects bound to the predecessor. At least
one digest-bound profile and both immutable OpenFGA compatibility/migration
identifiers are required.

Every `payload/` and `evidence/` regular file is listed once by path, media type,
integer length, and SHA-256 digest. `manifest.dsse.json` is the only outer-file
exception. Evidence admission is a closed typed contract rather than a text
denylist: v1 accepts the SBOM, provenance, conformance, license, and
vulnerability paths, their exact media types, and their strict JSON field
schemas. SLSA provenance additionally binds the exact manifest source
revision, dependency-lock digest, and sole `stead-policy-content-index`
subject digest equal to `policy_bundle_id`; well-formed but unrelated evidence
rejects. Security-profile mapping coverage must reuse a path explicitly marked
for that purpose in this same typed evidence registry; v1 registers the exact
synthetic mapping-test fixture with the policy-test-result media type, strict
`test_id`/`assertions` schema, profile-bound test ID, and SHA-256 digest.
Authoritative snapshots are likewise required at
`payload/<declared payload_path>`. An `external_regime_mapping` profile admits
only authoritative-snapshot source objects, requires at least one mapping, and
binds every snapshot and mapping evidence file into the signed manifest.
Unknown paths, wrong media, schema extensions (including post-signing identity
fields), private or credential fields, missing files, and digest mismatches all
reject. Free-form or protected evidence belongs in a separate authorized
evidence system and cannot enter this archive writer.

The digest-listed conformance report must claim 100% decision-row coverage, at
least 90% critical mutation score, and pass outcomes for deterministic replay,
label-lattice, explicit-deny, Agent-intersection, and provider bypass. The
embedded summary is labeled `unverified_presented_material`; WS-09 does not
authenticate the report producer or self-certify those claims. Runtime staging
must verify the immutable evidence and rerun deployable fixtures; it must not
claim to rerun source mutation analysis.

## DSSE profile and parser limits

The package implements DSSE v1.0.0 PAE and accepts the three non-interchangeable
ADR-0006 payload types. Writers use canonically padded standard RFC 4648 Base64;
bounded readers also accept canonically padded URL-safe Base64, but reject mixed
alphabets, absent/excess padding, duplicate JSON keys, case-folded known-member
aliases, duplicate key IDs, non-minimal DER, high-S, and cross-type
substitution. Genuine bounded unknown DSSE envelope extensions remain
ignorable. A streaming pass enforces the signature and unknown-extension
collection ceilings before reflective shape decoding can allocate maps or
slices. Activation-manifest, trust-set, and release-attestation payloads all use
exact-case, exact-member admission.

| Limit | V1 maximum |
|---|---:|
| Envelope bytes | 4 MiB |
| Decoded payload | 2 MiB |
| JSON nesting | 32 |
| Signatures | 16 |
| Members/items in one unknown extension collection | 256 |
| Encoded signature | 256 bytes |
| Decoded signature | 128 bytes |
| UTF-8 key ID | 80 bytes |
| Presented signing receipts | 16 |
| One metadata collection | 256 entries |
| Review receipts | 256 |
| Waiver receipts | 256 |

Caller-controlled file, manifest-metadata, review, waiver, and signing-receipt
cardinalities are checked before package allocation, copying, sorting, or map
construction. Both activation-manifest and release-attestation payloads must
fit the same 2 MiB decoded ceiling before any signing request is emitted.

`keyid` remains an unauthenticated selection hint. The builder checks exact
signature-byte receipt binding and counts distinct presented key-ID and
custodian claims. A canonical DER `r=1,s=1` plus arbitrary matching receipts is
therefore deliberately represented only as unverified syntax; the contract
regression proves it can never produce a verified/satisfied/authorizing WS-09
result. Only WS-06 may recompute SPKI identity, establish trust, verify
P-256/SHA-256 signatures, key purpose/status/validity/revocation, evaluate the
real threshold/custody rule, and grant activation authority.

## Strict ustar profile

Archive entries are lexical, owner/group zero and unnamed, timestamp zero, and
mode `0444` for files or `0555` for directories. The raw inspector accepts only
POSIX ustar `0` regular-file and `5` directory typeflags; the historical NUL
regular-file alias rejects. Every numeric field must use the writer's fixed
zero-padded octal plus canonical terminator, including the checksum's distinct
terminator. It rejects alternate space-padded or blank octal forms,
PAX/global-PAX, GNU long-name or long-link, sparse and other extensions;
absolute, traversal, backslash,
duplicate or unsorted paths; links, devices, FIFO/socket entries; setuid/setgid;
base-256 or overflowed sizes; malformed UTF-8; noncanonical metadata; bad
checksums; missing end blocks; and non-zero bytes after the end marker. It never
extracts to disk.

| Limit | V1 maximum |
|---|---:|
| Exact tar bytes | 64 MiB |
| Entries | 512 |
| Regular files, including the envelope | 256 |
| One regular file | 8 MiB |
| Total regular-file content | 48 MiB |
| UTF-8 path | 240 bytes |
| Path components | 16 |
| One component | 100 UTF-8 bytes |

All count/size arithmetic is checked before content slicing or allocation.
Zero-block record padding is allowed within the exact 64 MiB raw limit and is
therefore part of the archive digest; the deterministic writer emits its one
canonical representation.

## Assurance, custody, transport, and recovery

Signature/recovery/lowering thresholds, custodian separation, approved
cryptographic boundary, validated-module requirement, evidence profile, and
`request_boundary` or `commit_boundary` mode arrive only through the exact
typed deployment-policy binding. Profile IDs cannot select these values. The
starter threshold-one, threshold-two, and synthetic non-government
threshold-three fixtures prove the data-driven path.

The signed fixture/materialization inputs are strict JSON instances of the
repository's exact v0.1 contracts. Security profiles name
`https://stead.example/policies/security-label-profiles/profile-v0.1.schema.json`;
deployment policies name
`https://stead.example/policies/deployment-domains/domain-profile-v0.1.schema.json`.
Closed typed validators enforce required and unknown fields, nested shapes,
IDs, supported versions, semantic constants, profile-version ceilings, empty
v0.1 bridges, and exact assurance binding. The digest-bound
`PresentedAssuranceEvaluationV1` is also labeled unverified; its claimed result
does not replace downstream WS-06/WS-12 authentication or activation checks.

`ObservedWorkflow.BuildTransportDescriptor` names only exact archive and attestation-envelope
digests and always states `non_authorizing_transport_only`. TUF metadata, OCI
descriptors/tags, filenames, HTTPS, repository membership, and filesystem
ownership cannot replace either DSSE envelope or the deployment assurance
result. The golden vector verifies wholly from checked-in bytes with no network,
TUF, public PKI, transparency service, registry, KMS, or proprietary dependency.

## WS-09 lifecycle observation seam

`ObservedWorkflow` is the compile-time-mandatory boundary for unsigned
preparation, activation finalization, archive inspection and exact validation,
release-attestation preparation, release-handoff finalization, and
transport-descriptor construction. The deterministic primitives are
unexported, and contract tests type-check the package surface to reject any
public package-level bypass. Each admitted call attempts exactly one terminal
`LifecycleEvent` on success or failure. Events declare `authority: none`, name
WS-09 as producer and WS-07 as the durable-audit owner, and contain only stable
workflow/stage/outcome/error codes; bounded operation, correlation, and
causation identifiers; safe builder/build/release/signing workflow identities;
closed source revision, lock, recipe, evidence, archive, attestation, signing
request/result and threshold facts; and presented review/approval and waiver
counts. Signing, threshold, approval, and waiver facts are explicitly
`unverified_presented_material`; WS-09 does not turn them into verified facts.
Facts are populated only when the typed stage input already carries them:
prepare/finalize activation and prepare/finalize release retain the complete
builder, source/lock/recipe, signing, threshold, review, and waiver facts;
archive inspect/validate expose only archive identity and bounded entry/file
counts; transport exposes source plus the archive/attestation/policy and release
signing/threshold facts retained by `ImmutableReleaseHandoff`. The observer
never reparses protected bodies or invents facts absent from a stage boundary.

Lifecycle operation, correlation, causation, and generic workflow identities
are limited to 128 ASCII identifier bytes and are copied when the wrapper is
created. The separately typed build-recipe fact preserves the producer's full
1-to-256-byte opaque-ID domain. Trust-recovery and lowering approval thresholds
preserve every positive producer `int` exactly; signature thresholds remain
separately constrained to the producer's 1-to-16 signature contract. These
observation values are never passed into canonical encoders,
signing requests, DSSE envelopes, archives, attestations, handoffs, or transport
descriptors. Events expose no payload, envelope, archive, signature, key,
credential, protected body, source content, filesystem path, parser text,
arbitrary attributes, or metric-label map. The callback receives a value-only
event with no slices,
maps, pointers, or interfaces. Different lifecycle identifiers therefore leave
all typed and byte outputs identical.

Observation is fail closed. The transactional port contract requires a WS-07
adapter to atomically retain one terminal event and return its exact typed
`LifecycleAcknowledgement`; the package validates that receipt but cannot
enforce persistence behavior inside an adapter. Under this contract an error,
panic, or mismatched receipt means no event was accepted, returns only
`lifecycle_observer_failed`, and discards otherwise valid output. A conforming
adapter therefore cannot retain a success event when the public operation
returns observer failure. One `ObservedWorkflow` represents one serialized flow and acquires its
guard before any underlying computation. Concurrent entry and callback
reentry are admission failures: the nested call returns zero output with
`lifecycle_operation_in_progress`, performs no computation or recursive
observation, and leaves the one already-admitted call to produce its one
acknowledged terminal event. The observer interface itself performs no I/O and
grants no database, network, provider, filesystem, signing, policy, or
authorization capability. Implementations may pass the bounded event to a
separately authorized WS-07 adapter, but atomic durable audit/outbox commit,
retry, retention, metric projection, and delivery remain outside this package
and under WS-07 ownership.

Build/sign/archive/attestation interruption leaves no runtime state because this
module owns none. Retry from pinned source/lock/recipe and declared metadata;
reuse returned bytes only when their exact digests still match. Rollback is a
new forward release under current or stronger trust, never reuse of revoked or
stale signing evidence. Runtime stage/activate, monotonic anchors, failure
recovery, backup/restore, and audit/outbox transactions remain WS-06/WS-02/WS-07
owned.

## Fixtures and tests

`packages/test-fixtures/ci/policy-release/v1` contains synthetic source/evidence,
a full exact golden archive/attestation vector, WS-09 negative cases, and a
closed machine-readable WS-06 consumer-verifier mutation inventory whose exact
case set, operations, outcomes, and expected codes are contract-tested. Every
target/replacement is checked in, verification time is pinned, and the suite
mechanically resolves and applies every mutation. This execution contract is
mutation materialization only: it does not implement or simulate WS-06's
runtime verifier and does not assert the consumer codes. The inventory is
nonauthorizing handoff material, not evidence that WS-09 executed WS-06
verification. The vector uses a public,
non-secret, nonproduction P-256 scalar solely to make independent verification
repeatable. No private material exists in the fixture and its key has no Stead
trust authority.

`observation/lifecycle-contract.json` closes the allowed observation schema,
ownership, identifier ceiling, terminal outcomes, stage inventory, and exact
safe event/fact fields. It is a test contract only and is never included in a
release archive or signed payload.

### RG-03 control-flow branch-arm gate

`TestPolicyReleaseControlFlowBranchCoverage` is the executable branch gate for
the active, non-test Go sources returned for this package by the pinned
toolchain's `go list`. It is not a statement-region or coverprofile percentage
renamed as branch coverage. The denominator contains these control-flow arms:

- the true and false outcome of every `if`, including a synthesized false arm
  when the source omits `else`; every condition in an `else if` chain remains a
  separate two-outcome decision;
- every clause and the default outcome of expression and type switches, with a
  synthesized default arm when the source omits one;
- every communication and explicit default clause of a `select`; and
- body entry and normal exit for every potentially exiting `for` and every
  `range`. The exit marker after the loop executes on condition/range
  exhaustion or `break`, but not when a return, panic, or jump bypasses the
  continuation. A conditionless or compile-time-constant `for` fails analysis
  instead of adding a statically impossible body or exit arm to the denominator.

The test creates an isolated temporary repository copy, parses those package
sources with `go/ast`, and inserts a semantic no-op marker at the start of each
arm and immediately after each loop. It then runs the complete CI contract
package in an explicitly identified child process with `-count=1`,
`-covermode=count`, and `-coverpkg` restricted to `policyrelease`. Each marker
must map to exactly one compiler counter block. An arm is covered only when its
counter is nonzero; the test fails unless `covered * 100 >= total * 80` and
prints the exact numerator, denominator, percentage, and every uncovered source
position. Instrumented files and the profile exist only in the temporary copy.
Source containing `fallthrough` also fails analysis because count coverage
cannot distinguish case selection from fallthrough entry with this marker
contract.

Short-circuit operand edges within `&&` and `||` expressions are explicitly
outside this denominator. The approved Go compiler's count profile exposes
source-region counters, not operand-edge counters. Recovering those edges would
require semantic expression rewriting, which can change evaluation order,
side effects, panic behavior, and typed expression context; this gate does not
make that unsound claim. Analyzer self-tests prove that 100% ordinary statement
coverage cannot hide an unexecuted implicit-false arm, that synthetic
else/default markers do not execute on a taken explicit arm, and that switch,
type-switch, select, and loop body/exit outcomes lower or raise the metric while
the denominator remains stable.

Run:

```sh
scripts/run_pinned_go.sh go test ./tests/contract/ci -count=1
scripts/run_pinned_go.sh go test ./tests/contract/ci -run '^TestPolicyReleaseControlFlowBranchCoverage$' -count=1 -v
scripts/run_pinned_go.sh go test ./tests/contract/ci -run '^TestGoldenOfflineVector$' -count=1
scripts/run_pinned_go.sh go test ./tests/contract/ci -bench . -benchmem -count=5
```

`STEAD_PRINT_POLICY_GOLDEN=1` prints a candidate vector for review.
`STEAD_UPDATE_POLICY_GOLDEN=1` rewrites both checked-in golden vectors through
the deterministic fixture generator. A changed hash is a contract/release
review event; never regenerate merely to make a test pass.

The implementation uses only the Go standard library and the local module. It
adds no runtime, signing, archive, canonicalization, TUF, OCI, or cryptographic
dependency.
