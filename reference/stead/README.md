# Stead

Stead is an open-source, self-hostable, organization-wide open work and knowledge platform. Its single normative product and architecture specification is the [canonical Master Build Directive](docs/architecture/MASTER_BUILD_DIRECTIVE.md).

Phase 0 is approved and baselined at tag `phase0`, commit `e24a4d9d05ad6df19c5bcaa9c385ee74fd5d8c31`. Phase 1 is active: `STEAD-P1-001` is complete, and the next product implementation issue remains blocked only by its named pre-implementation ADR decisions. Phase 2–3 remain phase-gated.

## Current gate

`GATE-P0-APPROVED` is **approved** against tag `phase0` and immutable commit `e24a4d9d05ad6df19c5bcaa9c385ee74fd5d8c31`. The five required dispositions are recorded in the [Phase 0 Closeout Packet](docs/phase0/PHASE0_CLOSEOUT_PACKET.md). Approval opens dependency-ready work only; it does not waive ADR deadlines, issue acceptance criteria, independent review, or later release gates.

Validate the machine-readable Phase 0 planning package with:

```bash
ruby scripts/validate_phase0.rb
scripts/validate_json_schemas.sh
```

## Naming

**Stead** is the project and repository name. Directive-defined component contract names (`stead-web`, `stead-api`, `stead-worker`, and `steadctl`) remain in force unless an approved ADR supplies a compatibility and migration plan.

## License

New original core code is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE), subject to the directive's dependency and retained-notice rules. No dependency is approved merely because it appears in a draft plan.
